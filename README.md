# Phaser Games Test

This repo will contain different simple games I have created using phaser.js. 

**Why phaser.js you ask?**

After some research it became clear to me that this was a good framework to start with as it contained many of the starting components I would need to create games in a reasonable amount of time.

My main goal will be to build a game that contains a **cluster bomb gun**. Why? Becuase they are fucking awesome...that's why.

Good Day!
